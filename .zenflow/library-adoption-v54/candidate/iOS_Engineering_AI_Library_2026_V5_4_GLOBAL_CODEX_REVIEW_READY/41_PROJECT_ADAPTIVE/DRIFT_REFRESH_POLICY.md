# Adaptation Drift & Refresh Policy
> **GLOBAL CODEX EDITION — PATH MAPPING**  
> This document originated in the repository-local evolution of the library. In this global edition, any repository-local infrastructure path below is a **logical legacy alias**, not an instruction to create that path in a client repository. Map it as follows:
> - `.ai/project` / `.ai/adaptive` → the external per-repository state returned by `python3 "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/ios-engineering-shim/bin/ios_ai.py" path --repo .` (adaptive/generated data lives under that state directory).
> - `.ai/ios-library` → `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/ios-engineering-shim/library`.
> - `.ai/ios-core` → `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/ios-engineering-shim/core`.
> - `.ai/orchestration` → `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/ios-engineering-shim/orchestration` plus the external per-repository orchestration state.
> - `scripts/ai/...` → use the global `ios_ai.py` CLI above (or the exact command in an installed skill's `references/INSTALLATION.md`).
> - repository `.agents/skills` / `.codex/skills` → the **user-global skill root chosen by `install_global.py`**.
> - `REPOSITORY_KIT/repo-root` → historical packaging reference only; it is not installed into client repositories in this edition.
> **Never create/copy library `.ai`, `.agents`, `.codex`, or `scripts/ai` infrastructure inside a client repository unless the user explicitly asks for a repository-local export. Repository-local `AGENTS.md` and repository facts remain more specific than this global guidance.**


The model records a source fingerprint over relevant project/config/instruction files. A changed fingerprint means generated context may be stale.

Refresh after:
- project/target/scheme/test-plan changes;
- Package.swift/Package.resolved or dependency graph changes;
- CI/Fastlane/Make/release command changes;
- deployment/Swift language mode changes;
- persistence/auth/payments architecture changes;
- new extensions/widgets/background capabilities;
- major source-module moves.

Generated files must be reproducible from repository state. Human decisions belong in `.ai/project/DECISION_LOG.md`, not edited into generated output.

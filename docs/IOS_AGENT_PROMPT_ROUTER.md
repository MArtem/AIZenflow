# iOS Agent Prompt Router

## Purpose
Route work to the correct prompt/skill so reviews are not accidentally narrow.

## Working Procedures

Select the applicable row before implementation or review; combine only materially overlapping
concerns. Reuse current decisions and evidence. These are decision aids, not mandatory templates,
fixed counts of alternatives/tests, or authorization to execute the listed verification.
The reusable governance boundary maintains this router when a real task exposes a routing gap.

| Requested outcome | Useful procedure and compact output | Existing owner to consult |
|---|---|---|
| New feature or unclear behavior | Recover goal/current facts; resolve material unknowns; define observable success and relevant failure/recovery; choose the smallest useful slice before editing. | `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_STANDARD.md`; product-requirements-review prompt |
| Bug, crash or hang | Record symptom, affected version and impact; distinguish observations from hypotheses; seek evidence that can falsify the leading explanation. State causal confidence, mitigation versus fix, and the gap if reproduction is unavailable. Missing reproduction limits the claim; it does not block useful authorized static investigation. | `IOS_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`; testing/debugging route for actual diagnosis |
| Legacy migration or dependency change | Inventory affected consumers; preserve agreed outward behavior and data compatibility; identify an incremental boundary, stop point and feasible recovery. Do not infer that code rollback also restores migrated data. | `ENGINEERING_CHANGE_QUALITY_STANDARD.md`; relevant migration/package/build route |
| Concurrency or inconsistent state | Trace operation/task owner, shared state, each suspension point and what may change there; describe one credible interleaving, cancellation and stale-result policy before selecting a fix. Compiler acceptance or an actor annotation alone is insufficient proof. | `IOS_CONCURRENCY_RUNTIME_STANDARD.md`; concurrency prompt |
| UI/design implementation | Recover layout intent, existing tokens and relevant screen states; include long/localized content, loading/error/recovery and accessible interaction where affected. A single image does not establish adaptive correctness. | UI/design route and relevant accessibility/localization prompt |
| Architecture or cross-team choice | State decision and owner; compare meaningful alternatives including the simplest viable option, operational/migration costs and strongest objection. Record why now and a concrete revisit trigger when the decision is durable. No compulsory new abstraction or ADR for mechanical changes. | `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_GOVERNANCE.md`; architecture style route |
| Privacy/security or imported content | Trace actual assets, inputs, trust boundaries, side effects and controls; separate policy text from observed enforcement and name unverified boundaries. Do not export source or activate a local/cloud profile from a reference document. | security/privacy and input-validation routes |
| AI-powered product behavior | Start with user value and deterministic alternatives; follow the AI router for capability, data, validation, bounded execution, fallback and evaluation. Do not impose a provider, layer or model benchmark. | `agent-prompts/AI_iOS_TASK_ROUTER.md` |
| Review or readiness claim | Trace evidence-backed findings, try to disprove each, distinguish checked scope from unknowns, and match every completion claim to evidence. | `ENGINEERING_CHANGE_QUALITY_STANDARD.md`; evidence-based-completion-review prompt |
| Incident, release or rollout | Separate containment from permanent correction; identify impact, responsible owner, decision criteria and feasible recovery with data caveats. Proposed telemetry, flags, alerts or release actions remain proposals until in scope. | incident/release/observability route |

Choose specialists by the risk mechanism, not incidental words. For example: DTO decoding selects
API contracts; retry selects network resilience; durable replay selects offline sync. Identify
platform and capability applicability before using a platform-specific technique; never expand
supported platforms or restore excluded verification from a source example.

Only create an artifact when its decision will be consumed: a brief for unknown behavior, an ADR
for a durable trade-off, a hypothesis note for uncertain causality, a risk/evidence table for a
material gate, or a handoff for continuation. Reuse the existing owner and omit irrelevant fields.
Suggestions outside approved scope stay separate with value, cost and the smallest alternative.

## Routing Rules
- Feature request → `./docs/agent-prompts/product-requirements-review.md` then relevant domain prompts.
- UI/scroll/performance → `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-ui-state-rendering-review.md` and `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-performance-audit.md`.
- Async/tasks/main-thread → `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-concurrency-review.md`.
- Swift language/runtime/public API/ABI → `./.codex/skills/ios-swift-runtime/SKILL.md`.
- Media/files/cache → `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-memory-cache-media-review.md`.
- API/network → `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-network-resilience-review.md` and `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-api-contract-review.md`.
- Offline/sync/extensions/widgets → `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-offline-sync-review.md` and `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-lifecycle-background-review.md`.
- Security/privacy/permissions → `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-security-privacy-review.md` and, when external input is in scope, `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-input-validation-content-safety-review.md`. For a whole-project security audit, use the same prompt with whole-project scope; do not preload unrelated domain prompts.
- Identity/OAuth/passkeys/sessions/local authorization → `./.codex/skills/ios-identity-authentication/SKILL.md`.
- Xcode build/linking/binaries/dependency supply chain → `./.codex/skills/ios-build-system/SKILL.md`.
- Capabilities/entitlements/extensions/widgets/Live Activities/App Intents → `./.codex/skills/ios-platform-capabilities/SKILL.md`.
- Swift Testing/XCTest/debugging/LLDB/crash or hang diagnosis → `./.codex/skills/ios-testing-debugging/SKILL.md`.
- Accessibility → `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-accessibility-review.md`.
- Localization → `./docs/agent-prompts/localization-review.md`.
- Release/rollout → `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-release-readiness.md` and `./docs/agent-prompts/feature-flag-rollout-review.md`.
- App Review/privacy manifests/required reasons/compliance → `./.codex/skills/ios-app-store-compliance/SKILL.md`.
- Done/verified/production-ready claim → `./docs/agent-prompts/evidence-based-completion-review.md`.

## Stop Rule
If no route clearly fits, run `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-production-readiness-review.md` and list uncertain domains explicitly.

## Architecture Style Routing
- Use `./docs/agent-prompts/ios-architecture-style-review.md` with `./docs/IOS_ARCHITECTURE_STYLE_ROUTER.md` when code or requirements mention MVVM, SwiftUI native state, Clean/Layered, Coordinator, Modular, Hexagonal, TCA, Redux/Elm/UDF, ReactorKit, VIP/Clean Swift, VIPER, MVP, RIBs, or MVC migration.
- Do not apply architecture-specific rules that conflict with active project rules; report conflicts and ask for explicit user decision.

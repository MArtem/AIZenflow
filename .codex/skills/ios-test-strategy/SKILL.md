description: Use this skill to choose a permission-bounded iOS verification strategy when the user asks what/how to test, requests a verification matrix, or explicitly opens a production-confidence planning phase. Do not trigger for an ordinary code review merely because verification is mentioned.

# iOS Test Strategy

## Workflow
1. Classify the change: UI, domain, persistence, network, auth, media, migration, release, or refactor.
2. Pick the smallest verification that proves the risk.
3. Identify what build/tests/manual/profiling are required for production confidence.
4. State what is intentionally deferred and the remaining risk.

## Output
- Change classification.
- Required verification matrix.
- Commands/manual scenarios.
- Remaining risks.

description: Use this skill for durable offline mutation and synchronization: outbox/replay, pending operations, conflicts, idempotency across relaunch, app-group/widget/extension data, and optimistic failure recovery. Trigger when durable local state or reconciliation is in scope; a generic offline error state does not activate this route alone.

# iOS Offline Sync

## Workflow
1. Identify source of truth and mutation ownership.
2. Separate local, pending, acknowledged, failed, and conflicted states.
3. Check idempotency, replay, dedupe, and crash/relaunch behavior.
4. Check app-group atomic writes, quarantine, cleanup, and extension/widget ownership.
5. Report remaining risks when manual/relaunch verification is needed.
